# Journal for CrystalBoard


- Date 26/07/25
    - Idea: Make a custom mechanical keyboard with case made up of clear acrylic sheets stacked on top of each other, thus the name crystal board!
    - Work done - Finalised the layout, took it from keyboard-layout-editor.com and drawn all the rows and columns on that layout!
