# Journal for CrystalBoard


- Date 26/07/25
    - Idea: Make a custom mechanical keyboard with case made up of clear acrylic sheets stacked on top of each other, thus the name crystal board!
    - Work done - Finalised the layout, took it from keyboard-layout-editor.com and drawn all the rows and columns on that layout!

    - I made the complete schematic made the PCB layout but then I noticed that there is no space for Pi Pico. So I deleted the top right 3 keys, thus I had to do changes in the Kicad Schematic and PCB. Thus took some time but I am done with PCB routing. Now I am thinking to add some neopixels and some silkscreen to the PCB.
    - The updated keyboard layout looks like this now:

    - Things to do next - Put some Neopixels, Stabilizers, Plate, Silkscreen
